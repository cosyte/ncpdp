# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Versions and publishing are managed with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets);
this file is maintained by hand (Changesets handles the version bump and publish only).

## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the initial public API surface. The package begins
its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Added

- Project scaffold from the shared `@cosyte/*` parser template: the canonical toolchain (TypeScript
  ES2023 + strict rigor via `@cosyte/tsconfig`, ESLint 10 + type-checked `typescript-eslint` via
  `@cosyte/eslint-config`, Prettier via `@cosyte/prettier-config`, Vitest 4 + v8 coverage via
  `@cosyte/vitest-config`, dual ESM + CJS build via `tsup` + `@cosyte/tsup-config`, `attw` publish
  gate), thin callers of the reusable `cosyte/.github` CI/release workflows, Changesets on the
  `0.0.x` ladder, and the property-based conformance harness from `@cosyte/test-utils`.
- **SCRIPT NewRx structural read** (`@cosyte/ncpdp/script`): `parseScript(xml)` returns an immutable
  `ScriptMessage` and `newRx(msg)` projects the NewRx body — header (version/messageId/to/from/
  sentTime), patient, pharmacy, prescriber, and medication (coded drug + explicit strength surfaced
  side-by-side, never reconciled), with XPath-positioned tolerance warnings. Lenient by default:
  vendor quirks become `SCRIPT_WARNING_CODES`; only unrecoverable structural corruption throws a
  typed `NcpdpScriptParseError` (`SCRIPT_FATAL_CODES`). XXE-safe by construction (DOCTYPE/ENTITY
  payloads are refused). Supports SCRIPT `v2017071` + `v2022011`.
- **Shared `@cosyte/ncpdp/common` vocabulary**: `decimalValue` (float-free decimal validity),
  `ndcValue` (NDC segmentation classification), `recognizeCodeSystem`/`codedValue` (NDC/RXNORM/
  SNOMED/NCI/ICD10 qualifier mapping), and XPath position helpers.
- Runtime dependency on [`fast-xml-parser`](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser)
  for safe, namespace-aware XML parsing on the SCRIPT side — ratified in
  [`docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md`](./docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md). The Telecom side remains zero-dep.

### Changed
