## [Unreleased]

The first pre-alpha release (`0.0.1`) will ship the initial public API surface. The package begins
its public history at `0.0.x`, per the cosyte version ladder (`0.0.x` until first alpha).

### Added

- **Telecom foundation + B1 billing-claim read** (`@cosyte/ncpdp/telecom`): opens the second,
  **zero-dep** standard. `parseTelecom(raw: string | Buffer, opts?)` validates the FS/GS/RS
  (`0x1C`/`0x1D`/`0x1E`) control-character framing, decodes the fixed 56-byte vD.0 Transaction Header
  (BIN, Version/Release, Transaction Code, PCN, Transaction Count, Service Provider ID + Qualifier, Date
  of Service, Software/Cert ID — leading zeros preserved, pad trimmed), and tokenizes the
  Segment-Identification (`AM`)-keyed, field-id-keyed variable segments. `claim(t)` lifts a B1/B2/B3
  **request** view: Patient (DOB, gender), Insurance (group, cardholder, person code), Claim (Rx
  reference + qualifier, fill, product, quantity, days supply, DAW) and Prescriber (id + qualifier).
  **Quantity Dispensed is never a float** — the implied 3-place decimal (`9(7)v999`) is applied
  string-wise (`"30000"` → `"30.000"`) alongside the verbatim source. Fail-safe: missing header →
  `NCPDP_TELECOM_NO_HEADER`, unframeable body → `NCPDP_TELECOM_INVALID_FRAMING` (a separator is never
  guessed), untrusted version → `NCPDP_TELECOM_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, empty → `EMPTY_INPUT`; the **F6**
  stamp is recognized-but-not-decoded (`NCPDP_TELECOM_VF6_NOT_DECODED`, its header layout differs from
  D.0); unknown segments/fields, a missing `AM`, malformed tokens, and extra (truncated) transactions
  all warn and preserve verbatim. Warnings carry a stable code + byte offset + field id, never a value
  (PHI-safe). Spec traceability in `docs-content/spec-notes-telecom.md`. Responses, B2/B3, E1, compound,
  and COB land in later phases; no serializer yet.
- **SCRIPT structured SIG decode** (`@cosyte/ncpdp/script`): `medication.sig` exposes a `StructuredSig`
  — a best-effort, **lossy** decode of the SCRIPT `<Sig>` into typed dosing components
  (`doseDeliveryMethod`, `dose`, `doseUnitOfMeasure`, `route`, `siteOfAdministration`,
  `administrationTiming`, `duration`, `vehicle`, `indication`, `maximumDoseRestriction`). The free-text
  `SigText` is preserved **verbatim** and remains the source of truth; the structured view is additive
  and never reconciled against it — when they disagree, both are surfaced. Every component is a
  `SigField` tagged `coded`/`derived`/`absent`; a `coded` field keeps its qualifier verbatim and resolves
  the system (SNOMED CT / NCI / NDC / RxNorm / ICD-10, else `UNKNOWN`), giving route/site/method/unit
  provenance. An ambiguous dose (a dose structure with no readable quantity) is surfaced as `absent`
  rather than guessed, raising the new `NCPDP_SCRIPT_SIG_AMBIGUOUS_DOSE`; any structured decode raises the
  new `NCPDP_SCRIPT_SIG_STRUCTURED_LOSSY` to flag the lossy view. Decode-only (no SIG generation, no
  natural-language parsing); element-name tolerance for the membership-gated IG nesting is documented in
  `docs-content/spec-notes-structured-sig.md`. Covers SCRIPT `v2017071` + `v2022011`.
- **SCRIPT prescription-lifecycle transactions** (`@cosyte/ncpdp/script`): reads the six renewal /
  change / cancel transactions — `RxRenewalRequest`/`RxRenewalResponse`,
  `RxChangeRequest`/`RxChangeResponse`, `CancelRx`/`CancelRxResponse` — via
  `rxRenewalRequest()`/`rxRenewalResponse()`/`rxChangeRequest()`/`rxChangeResponse()`/`cancelRx()`/
  `cancelRxResponse()` accessors (and `ScriptMessage#asLifecycleRequest`/`asLifecycleResponse`).
  Requests project patient, pharmacy, prescriber, and the prescribed medication with the same
  semantics as NewRx. Responses expose a **fail-safe** `outcome`
  (`approved`/`approvedWithChanges`/`denied`/`deniedNewToFollow`/`replace`/`validated`/`unknown`):
  a `<Denied>` is **never** read as an approval, an unrecognized or absent outcome reads as
  `unknown` (never assumed approved, raising `LIFECYCLE_OUTCOME_UNRECOGNIZED`), and a malformed
  response carrying multiple outcome choices resolves denial-first and raises
  `LIFECYCLE_AMBIGUOUS_OUTCOME`. `approvalOf(outcome)` gives a coarse, one-directional
  `affirmative`/`negative`/`indeterminate` read. For `approvedWithChanges` the **changed**
  `medicationPrescribed` is surfaced (whether a sibling of `<Response>` or nested inside the outcome
  element) so a consumer dispenses the change, not the original. Reason fields
  (`code`/`referenceNumber`/`denialReason`/`note`) are verbatim. Covers SCRIPT `v2017071` +
  `v2022011`.
- **SCRIPT response spine** (`@cosyte/ncpdp/script`): reads the three acknowledgment transactions —
  `Status` (positive), `Error` (negative), `Verify` — exposed via `status()`/`error()`/`verify()`
  accessors (and `ScriptMessage#asStatus`/`asError`/`asVerify`). `Code`, `DescriptionCode`, and
  `Description` are surfaced **verbatim** (no bundled NCPDP code→meaning table). A `disposition`
  accessor (`"success"`/`"error"`/`"verify"`/`undefined`) is derived only from the body kind, so an
  `Error` can **never** be read as a success; a malformed message carrying multiple response bodies
  reports the most conservative disposition (`Error` first) and raises the new
  `RESPONSE_AMBIGUOUS_DISPOSITION` warning. `correlatesTo` exposes `<RelatesToMessageID>` so a
  response can be tied back to its request. Covers SCRIPT `v2017071` + `v2022011`.
- Project scaffold from the shared `@cosyte/*` parser template: the canonical toolchain (TypeScript
  ES2023 + strict rigor via `@cosyte/tsconfig`, ESLint 10 + type-checked `typescript-eslint` via
  `@cosyte/eslint-config`, Prettier via `@cosyte/prettier-config`, Vitest 4 + v8 coverage via
  `@cosyte/vitest-config`, dual ESM + CJS build via `tsup` + `@cosyte/tsup-config`, `attw` publish
  gate), thin callers of the reusable `cosyte/.github` CI/release workflows, Changesets on the
  `0.0.x` ladder, and the property-based conformance harness from `@cosyte/test-utils`.
- **SCRIPT NewRx structural read** (`@cosyte/ncpdp/script`): `parseScript(xml)` returns an immutable
  `ScriptMessage` and `newRx(msg)` projects the NewRx body — header (version/messageId/to/from/
  sentTime), patient, pharmacy, prescriber, and medication (coded drug + explicit strength surfaced
  side-by-side, never reconciled), with XPath-positioned tolerance warnings. Lenient by default:
  vendor quirks become `SCRIPT_WARNING_CODES`; only unrecoverable structural corruption throws a
  typed `NcpdpScriptParseError` (`SCRIPT_FATAL_CODES`). XXE-safe by construction (DOCTYPE/ENTITY
  payloads are refused). Supports SCRIPT `v2017071` + `v2022011`.
- **Shared `@cosyte/ncpdp/common` vocabulary**: `decimalValue` (float-free decimal validity),
  `ndcValue` (NDC segmentation classification), `recognizeCodeSystem`/`codedValue` (NDC/RXNORM/
  SNOMED/NCI/ICD10 qualifier mapping), and XPath position helpers.
- Runtime dependency on [`fast-xml-parser`](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/fast-xml-parser)
  for safe, namespace-aware XML parsing on the SCRIPT side — ratified in
  [`docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md`](./docs/adr/0001-xml-parser.md). The Telecom side remains zero-dep.
