/**
 * `@cosyte/ncpdp` two-file-contract gate.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPO PROMISES, WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THIS GATE ASSERTS. On 2026-08-04 this repo's
 * guidance was split in two: `CLAUDE.md` became a cursor plus rules plus traps, and
 * `documentation/agent-notes.md` took the narrative, with `CLAUDE.md` pointing into it by anchor.
 * Nothing was deleted; the reasoning moved behind a link, which makes the link load-bearing in a
 * way it was not before. A rule in `CLAUDE.md` now reads "never do X. Why:" followed by an anchor
 * into the narrative file, and if that anchor does not exist the reader gets an imperative with no
 * grounding, which is exactly the "prose no test can check" shape this repo's own text warns about.
 * Three things can break silently and none of them had a check:
 *
 *   1. the narrative file stops existing (a rename, a bad merge, a `git rm`);
 *   2. a section is emptied down to its heading, so a pointer resolves to nothing; and
 *   3. an anchor is edited on one side of the pair and not the other, so a pointer dangles.
 *
 * This gate checks those three, on this tree, and nothing else.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ▶ IT IS NAMED FOR WHAT IT CHECKS AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT A UNIVERSAL, AND THAT IS THE MOST
 * IMPORTANT LINE IN THIS FILE.
 *
 * The two-file split was applied across the cosyte tree, so the tempting framing is "every repo has
 * a `CLAUDE.md` and a narrative file, and this gate enforces the contract". MEASURED 2026-08-06 on
 * the umbrella's own checkout: `config`, `hl7`, `workflow`, `crew`, `knowledgebase`, `.github` and
 * `claude-containers` have NO narrative file at all. So the ecosystem-wide contract is either not
 * universal or is violated in seven places, and a gate written as though it were universal would be
 * asserting something seven repos disprove. That is an OVERCLAIM, and an overclaiming guard is
 * worse than a narrow one: it invites a reader to trust a promise the tree does not keep, and the
 * first repo that trips it deletes the gate instead of fixing anything.
 *
 * So: this gate asserts `ncpdp`'s contract. `ncpdp` HAS a narrative file, its `CLAUDE.md` points
 * into it by anchor throughout, and its `CLAUDE.md` sits at its byte budget with the narrative
 * already relocated, so here the pointer relationship is real and paid for. Whether every OTHER
 * repo owes the same thing is a question for whoever owns the convention, and it is not answered by
 * a script inside one package. DO NOT WIDEN THIS FILE TO CLAIM IT.
 *
 * The corollary, which is the same rule pointing the other way: this gate lives in `ncpdp`'s own
 * CI, so it costs the umbrella's capped automation plane nothing. Porting it to a sibling means
 * copying the SHAPE into that sibling and RE-DERIVING ITS SCAN SURFACE, exactly as
 * `check-no-internal-refs.sh` was ported here. It does not mean one shared script, and this repo is
 * the proof that the re-derivation is not a formality: see the next section.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ▶ THIS REPO WRITES TWO POINTER FORMS, AND A MATCHER COPIED FROM A SIBLING WOULD SEE A HANDFUL.
 *
 * `mllp`'s copy of this gate matches one shape, the path-qualified `<basename>#<anchor>`. Measured
 * on this tree with that matcher alone: a single-figure count, all of it in `CLAUDE.md`. This
 * repo's dominant form is the BARE one, a backtick-delimited `#<anchor>` written after a `Why:`,
 * an order of magnitude more of them, almost all in `CLAUDE.md` plus a self-reference inside the
 * narrative file. A gate that matched only the qualified form would have printed `all resolving`
 * while saying nothing at all about the large majority of the pointers on the tree, and the OK
 * line's arithmetic would have looked perfectly healthy while it did so. THE ANCHOR OF A SWEEP IS
 * PART OF ITS CLAIM.
 *
 * DO NOT TRUST THIS HEADER FOR THE TOTALS, for the reason `scripts/check-test-selection.ts` states
 * about its own: a figure written into a comment goes stale on the next commit without anyone
 * touching it, and this file's first draft carried two that were already wrong when it landed. THE
 * OK LINE PRINTS BOTH COUNTS ON EVERY RUN, because it measures rather than remembers. So there are
 * two matchers, and each states its own domain:
 *
 *   * QUALIFIED, `<basename>#<anchor>`: matched in EVERY opened file, with no filename scope. A
 *     pointer at the narrative file is a pointer wherever it is written, and this repo has them
 *     outside `CLAUDE.md` in its history.
 *   * BARE, a backtick, `#`, the anchor, a backtick: matched in the CURSOR and in the NARRATIVE
 *     FILE ONLY. Elsewhere the shape is genuinely ambiguous rather than merely noisy, and that is
 *     measured rather than assumed: `CHANGELOG.md` carries backticked pull-request references and
 *     `src/script/xml-load.ts` carries the XML text-node key, which is that exact shape and is not
 *     a pointer at anything. Widening this matcher to the whole corpus turns those into findings.
 *
 * A BARE ANCHOR OF DIGITS ONLY IS NOT A POINTER. GitHub renders `#` followed by a number as an
 * issue or pull-request reference, and the narrative file uses it that way. Those are counted and
 * reported on the OK line rather than dropped in silence, because a matcher that quietly declines
 * to look at some of its own hits is the defect this section exists to prevent. The disclosed cost
 * is that a heading whose text is only digits would be unreachable through the bare form; the
 * qualified form still reaches it, and no such heading exists here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ▶ EXISTENCE IS NOT OBSERVATION, WHICH IS WHY THE OK LINE RECONCILES.
 *
 * The failure this gate is most likely to have is not a wrong answer, it is a right-looking answer
 * over a corpus it never opened. That is not hypothetical here: this repo's own PHI scanner printed
 * `OK` over an EMPTIED scan root, and the remedy that closed it is the one used here, RECONCILIATION
 * AGAINST THE INDEX rather than a denominator. A denominator counts the roots that DID exist.
 *
 * BE PRECISE ABOUT WHICH PART OF THAT DOES THE WORK. The property that prevents the defect is
 * STRUCTURAL, not arithmetic: THERE IS NO DECLARED ROOT TO BE WRONG ABOUT. The corpus is whatever
 * `git ls-files` returns, THERE IS NO EXCLUSION LIST OF ANY KIND, and every path in it is opened or
 * REFUSED. `read` must equal `tracked` or this gate refuses.
 *
 * THAT LAST SENTENCE IS WHY THERE IS NO BINARY SKIP HERE, AND THE DIFFERENCE FROM `mllp` IS
 * DELIBERATE. `mllp` skips a NUL-bearing file and discloses it as a miss, because it vendors a
 * compressed tarball that cannot be read as markdown and cannot be edited to clear a red. This repo
 * vendors nothing of the kind: measured over EVERY tracked path, ZERO carry a NUL byte and ZERO
 * fail to round-trip as UTF-8, and `scripts/check-no-emdash.sh` here is the text-only variant that
 * already depends on exactly that. So a NUL-bearing tracked file is a REFUSAL rather than a skip.
 * A sibling once re-added a skip like that on the very file another sweep had silently missed,
 * while three copies of its prose still claimed no exclusion list; there is no skip to describe
 * wrongly here, which is the cheapest way to not have that defect.
 *
 * THE PRINTED ARITHMETIC IS A WEAKER THING AND IS NOT THE REMEDY. It is reconciled over SETS of
 * paths rather than a pair of counters, which buys something a counter cannot: a counter
 * incremented once per iteration can only ever sum to the number of iterations, so comparing that
 * sum to the corpus size is a tautology. Sets catch a path enumerated twice and a path no branch
 * reached. On a healthy `git ls-files` neither occurs, so treat the printed sum as SOMETHING A
 * READER CAN CHECK BY EYE, not as evidence the scan was complete.
 *
 * Further refusals exist for the same reason, and each is a case where "no violations" would be a
 * lie rather than a result:
 *   * zero tracked paths (not a repo, or a `--root` pointed at an empty tree);
 *   * a tracked path that is missing, unreadable, a symlink, a FIFO, or not a regular file;
 *   * a tracked path carrying a NUL byte, per the paragraph above;
 *   * an UNMERGED path, which `git ls-files -s` reports three times and whose working-tree copy is
 *     conflict markers nobody has yet decided the contents of;
 *   * two tracked files carrying the contract basename, which makes every pointer ambiguous; and
 *   * ZERO POINTERS FROM EITHER MATCHER. Not zero overall: zero from EITHER FORM, separately. In
 *     THIS repo neither can be a clean tree, because both forms are in use on it today and the
 *     counts are printed on every OK line. One matcher silently ceasing to match is precisely how
 *     this gate would come to report on 3 pointers while believing it reported on 36, and a
 *     combined count would hide it behind the other form. This refusal is grounded in what THIS
 *     repo contains and is one of the things a port must re-derive. Converting the tree to a single
 *     pointer form is a deliberate change that must update this grounding, not route around it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EXIT CODES, matching `scripts/phi-scan.ts` so the two gates read the same way.
 *   0  the contract holds.
 *   1  the contract is broken: a missing file, an empty section, or a dangling pointer.
 *   2  REFUSAL. The gate could not observe what it claims to check. Never reported as clean.
 *
 * The split matters: exit 1 is a finding a human acts on, exit 2 is "believe nothing I said".
 * Collapsing them would turn a broken scanner into a list of false findings, which reads as
 * actionable and is worse than a crash.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DISCLOSED MISSES. Stated here rather than discovered later.
 *
 * WHICH OF THESE A TEST PINS IS MARKED PER ITEM. A DISCLOSURE THAT NAMES A TEST MUST NAME ONE THAT
 * EXISTS, or the disclosure is doing the same work the overclaim it warns about does. [PINNED]
 * means a case in `test/scripts/agent-notes.test.ts` exercises it IN THE DIRECTION IT FAILS.
 * [SCOPE] means it is a boundary of what this gate is for, with nothing to execute.
 *
 *  (i)   [PINNED] A POINTER SPLIT ACROSS A LINE WRAP IS NOT REJOINED, so it reds. `mllp` carries a
 *        join for this; it is deliberately absent here, because every one of this tree's 36
 *        pointers sits inside an inline code span, a span cannot be split by a wrap, and
 *        `@cosyte/prettier-config` sets `proseWrap: preserve` so nothing reflows these lines behind
 *        a maintainer's back. The direction of the miss is FALSE RED, which is the safe direction,
 *        and the remedy if it ever fires is to unwrap the pointer, never to widen the matcher.
 *  (ii)  [PINNED] A PERCENT-ENCODED OR HTML-ENTITY ANCHOR IS NOT DECODED. An anchor written with a
 *        `%` is matched only up to the `%` and reds. No such pointer exists on this tree.
 *  (iii) [PINNED] A POINTER AT ANY OTHER FILE'S ANCHOR IS OUT OF SCOPE, including `CLAUDE.md`'s own
 *        anchors. This gate is about the narrative file. A general markdown link checker is a
 *        different tool with a different failure surface, and writing half of one here would be the
 *        overclaim this file's second section refuses.
 *  (iv)  [PINNED] A POINTER INSIDE A FENCED CODE BLOCK IS TREATED EXACTLY LIKE PROSE. Deliberate: a
 *        reader follows it either way. Headings are the opposite, see (vi).
 *  (v)   [PINNED] THE BARE FORM IS NOT MATCHED OUTSIDE THE CURSOR AND THE NARRATIVE FILE. A bare
 *        anchor written into `README.md`, a source comment or a workflow is never read as a
 *        pointer, so it cannot red and cannot be proved to resolve. The qualified form is the one
 *        that works everywhere, and it is what to write outside the pair. Measured cost today: no
 *        bare pointer at the narrative file exists outside the pair, and the two shapes that DO
 *        exist outside it are not pointers at all.
 *  (vi)  [PINNED] AN ATX HEADING INSIDE A FENCED CODE BLOCK IS NOT AN ANCHOR, and the fence tracker
 *        is why. Without it a `#` comment in a shell sample mints a phantom anchor and masks the
 *        dangling pointer this gate exists to catch. That is not hypothetical in this file's target:
 *        the narrative file embeds a shell reproduction whose comment lines start at column 0. The
 *        tracker handles ``` and ~~~ fences of three or more characters. It does NOT track an
 *        INDENTED code block as a block, but that is not reachable as a phantom anchor: `ATX_RE`
 *        bounds indentation at three spaces, so a four-space-indented `#` line is not a heading
 *        here either, which is what CommonMark does anyway. Both halves are asserted.
 *  (vii) [PINNED] THE SLUGGER IS A TRANSCRIPTION OF github-slugger, NOT THE MODULE. `SLUG_CASES`
 *        below is drawn from real headings in this repo's narrative file plus the shapes that
 *        diverge from the obvious implementation: a dropped LEADING character, a NON-ASCII space
 *        separator, a SOFTBREAK, and a REPEATED heading (the dedup block in `selfTest`, NOT
 *        `SLUG_CASES`). THE SHAPES BELOW ARE UNTESTED AND ARE NOT CLAIMED (no count here on
 *        purpose): combining marks and CJK, because none exists here, and CONNECTOR PUNCTUATION
 *        other than `_`, which upstream keeps and this keep-class deletes. That last one is not
 *        false-red only: THE DELETION SHIFTS THE DEDUP, which is false-GREEN. A heading needing any
 *        of these is the signal to test it, not to assume.
 *  (viii)[SCOPE] A SECTION WITH A BODY IS NOT A SECTION WITH THE RIGHT BODY. This gate proves a
 *        pointer lands somewhere non-empty. It cannot prove the prose there grounds the rule that
 *        cited it. That half stays human, and saying so is the point of writing it down.
 *  (ix)  [SCOPE] IT DOES NOT CHECK ANY BYTE BUDGET. `CLAUDE.md`'s ceiling is enforced by the
 *        umbrella's `.claude/hooks/doc-budget.mjs`, which holds the budget table; a script inside
 *        this package cannot see it and must not keep a second copy of a number.
 *  (x)   [PINNED] ENCODING. Every tracked path is decoded as UTF-8, and the limit was measured in
 *        BOTH directions rather than assumed, by encoding one real pointer with `iconv` and running
 *        it through this matcher. Three different outcomes, so do not round them off to "non-UTF-8
 *        is not read":
 *          * WINDOWS-1252 IS MATCHED. The pointer's own bytes are ASCII there, and a stray high
 *            byte elsewhere in the line only becomes U+FFFD.
 *          * EBCDIC (IBM037) and UTF-7 ARE READ AND NEVER MATCH, a silent miss in both cases. The
 *            UTF-7 reason is not the obvious one: `iconv` escapes `#` itself as `+ACM-`, so the
 *            pointer does not survive even though the rest of the line is plain ASCII. An earlier
 *            draft of this line claimed UTF-7 matched, for exactly that obvious-looking reason,
 *            and the measurement said otherwise.
 *          * UTF-16 and UTF-32 REFUSE rather than miss quietly, because they carry NUL bytes. That
 *            is the difference the no-skip rule above buys, and it is the reason this entry is
 *            [PINNED] rather than [SCOPE].
 *
 * Run it locally with `pnpm check:agent-notes`, also reached by `pnpm check`. `pnpm test` runs it
 * against this tree too (`test/scripts/agent-notes.test.ts`), which is what puts it on the
 * meta-repo's `scripts/verify.sh ncpdp` ladder and on the required `ci / verify` contexts without
 * either of them needing to name it.

 * ▶ NO `.trim()`. github-slugger does not trim: it deletes the disallowed character and leaves the

 * ▶ A SOFTBREAK IS DELETED, NOT HYPHENATED, WHICH IS WHY THE SETEXT JOIN USES `\n`. A wrapped

/**
 * A section is EMPTY when nothing but blank lines separates its heading from the next heading or
 * from the end of the file. That is the check the item asks for and it is deliberately the weak
 * form: see disclosed miss (viii). A heading whose only body is a fence or a single word counts as
 * non-empty, because judging sufficiency is not something a script can do honestly.
 *
 * ▶ A CONTAINER IS NOT AN EMPTIED SECTION, AND CONFLATING THEM IS A FALSE RED. A heading
 * immediately followed by a DEEPER one (`## Group` then `### Sub` with no prose between) is a
 * container whose body IS its subsections. A pointer at the container resolves on GitHub and the
 * reader lands on real content, so reporting it is a red against a link that works. This repo
 * REACHES that shape: its narrative file opens several `##` sections directly onto their first
 * `###`.
 *
 * This is the item's own criterion read literally. The item asks for the case where a section is
 * "emptied down to its heading"; a container has not been emptied, it never held prose of its own.
 * It also matches the rule `ccda` shipped for the same gate, and it is the direction of care this
 * whole file is built around: an overclaiming guard invites a reader to trust a promise the tree
 * does not keep, and the first false red is what gets a gate deleted rather than fixed.
 *
 * IT OPENS NO FALSE-GREEN HOLE, which is the only direction that would matter. The exemption moves
 * the obligation DOWN rather than removing it: the deeper heading is still checked, so an emptied
 * leaf still reds, and a container can only be exempt when something deeper exists to carry the
 * body. A trailing heading has no `next` at all and is therefore never a container. Both directions
 * are pinned in `test/scripts/agent-notes.test.ts`.

 * ▶ ONE OPEN, THEN `fstat` AND READ THROUGH THAT SAME DESCRIPTOR. NOT `lstat`-then-read-by-path.
 *
 * `lstatSync(abs)` then `readFileSync(abs)` is a TIME-OF-CHECK/TIME-OF-USE RACE, and CodeQL runs on
 * this repo as a required context and flags it `js/file-system-race` at high severity. The two
 * calls resolve the path INDEPENDENTLY, so what was checked and what was read need not be the same
 * object: anything that can replace the path between them (a concurrent `git checkout`, a rebase,
 * an editor's atomic save, a hostile symlink swap) gets its bytes read under a path this gate
 * already decided was a safe regular file. The symlink refusal is the one that matters, because
 * defeating it is how bytes from OUTSIDE the tree get scanned and reported on as though they were
 * tracked content.
 *
 * The fix is structural rather than a re-check, because a re-check is the same race again. The path
 * is resolved EXACTLY ONCE, by `openSync`, and every question after that is asked of the resulting
 * descriptor, which is bound to one inode for its lifetime:
 *
 *   * `O_NOFOLLOW` makes the SYMLINK REFUSAL PART OF THE OPEN. The kernel fails with `ELOOP` rather
 *     than handing back a descriptor on the target, so there is no window between "is it a link"
 *     and "read it". This is the half the race actually threatened.
 *   * `O_NONBLOCK` is not decoration: opening a FIFO for reading BLOCKS until a writer appears, so
 *     a tracked FIFO would hang the gate forever instead of refusing it. With it, the open returns
 *     and `fstat` classifies it.
 *   * `fstatSync(fd)` asks about the OPENED OBJECT, not about a path that may since have moved.
 *
 * STATED LIMIT: `O_NOFOLLOW` only refuses a symlink as the FINAL path component. A symlinked PARENT
 * DIRECTORY is still traversed. Closing that needs `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH)`, which Node does not
 * expose, and `scripts/check-no-emdash.sh` walks the same corpus with the same boundary.
 *
 * If `O_NOFOLLOW` is unavailable (it is not defined on Windows), the gate REFUSES rather than
 * quietly dropping the symlink guarantee. A gate that cannot keep a promise says so.
